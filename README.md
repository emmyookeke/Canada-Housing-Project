Real-Time Data Fetching and Streaming from Statistics Canada
This project focuses on fetching real-time data from Statistics Canada and streaming it to various destinations for further analysis and usage. The data is fetched using Kafka server and Zookeeper, then streamed to a website for real-time display. Additionally, the data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in JSON format for further processing, including crawling and query analysis.

Overview
The project involves the following components and steps:

Data Fetching: Real-time data is fetched from Statistics Canada using Kafka server and Zookeeper. The data could include various statistics such as economic indicators, demographic data, or social trends.

Streaming to Website: The fetched data is streamed to a website for real-time display. This could involve setting up a WebSocket server or utilizing a real-time data streaming service.

Storage in Amazon S3: The fetched data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in JSON format. This allows for easy access, scalability, and compatibility with other AWS services.

Further Usage: The stored data can be utilized for various purposes, including crawling for data aggregation, performing query analysis, generating reports, or feeding into machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Technologies Used
Kafka: Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
Zookeeper: Distributed coordination service used by Kafka for managing and coordinating cluster nodes.
Amazon S3: Object storage service for storing and retrieving data.
WebSocket: Protocol for real-time communication between a client and a server.
AWS SDK: Software development kit for interacting with AWS services programmatically.
JSON: Data interchange format used for storing and transmitting structured data.
Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building and displaying the website interface.
Usage
Data Fetching: Run Kafka server and Zookeeper to fetch real-time data from Statistics Canada. Monitor the data stream for any errors or interruptions.

Streaming to Website: Set up a WebSocket server or utilize a real-time data streaming service to stream the fetched data to the website. Ensure real-time updates and smooth user experience.

Storage in Amazon S3: Configure Amazon S3 bucket and permissions to store the fetched data in JSON format. Set up data retention policies and versioning if necessary.

Further Usage: Utilize the stored data for various purposes such as crawling, query analysis, reporting, or predictive modeling. Integrate with other services or applications as needed.

Future Enhancements
Implement data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and reliability.
Enhance the website interface with interactive features, data visualization, and user customization options.
Explore advanced analytics techniques such as sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, or predictive modeling on the stored data.
